The array elements, so-called stations, are located in the Netherlands and in neighbouring countries. The design of LOFAR allows independent use of its international stations, which, coupled with a dedicated backend, makes them very powerful telescopes in their own right. This backend is called the Advanced Radio Transient Event Monitor and Identification System (ARTEMIS). It is a combined software/hardware solution for both targeted observations and real-time searches for millisecond radio transients which uses Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) technology to remove interstellar dispersion and detect millisecond radio bursts from astronomical sources in real-time.},

Here, we present an observation method to study the Jovian decametric radio emissions from several LOFAR stations (here Birr Castle in Ireland, Nan\c{c}ay in France, and Postdam in Germany), at high temporal and spectral resolution. This method is based on prediction tools, such as radio emission simulations and probability maps, and data processing. We report an observation of Io-induced decametric emission from 2021 June, and a first case study of the substructures that compose the macroscopic emissions (called millisecond bursts). The study of these bursts makes it possible to determine the electron populations at the origin of these emissions. We then present several possible future avenues for study based on these observations. The methodology and study perspectives described in this paper can be applied to new observations of Jovian radio emissions induced by Io, but also by Ganymede or Europa, or Jovian auroral radio emissions.},

  abstract = {Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit detectable radio bursts sporadically. They are outliers in the neutron star population, in many observable properties, but by their nature are practically difficult to study in depth. In this paper, we present the results from 1408 h of observations of RRAT candidates using the Irish Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) station at 150 MHz. As of October 2022, this census involved observing 113 sources, leading to 29 detections which were then followed up systematically. Single-pulse emission was detected from 25 sources, and periodic emission from 14 sources. 18 sources were found to have emission behaviour that is not discussed in prior works using LOFAR instruments. Four novel or modified source periods have been determined, ranging from 1.507-3.921 s, and 8 new or updated phase-coherent pulsar timing ephemerides have been produced using detected bursts. One unexpected single-pulse with a clearly-Galactic dispersion measure was detected as a part of this work, but has not been re-detected in follow-up observations. Observations are ongoing to expand the number of observed sources and further characterise and improve ephemerides for the detected sources. This census has demonstrated the capability for international LOFAR stations to detect, monitor and characterise a significant fraction of these unique sources.},

PSRDADA allows more than one data set to be queued in the ring buffer at one time, and data may be recorded in selected bursts using data validity flags. A variety of clients have been implemented that can write data to the ring buffer and read data from it. The primary write clients can be controlled via a simple, text-based socket interface, and read client software exists for writing data to an array of disks, sending data to an array of nodes, or processing the data directly from RAM. At the highest level of control and configuration, scripts launch the PSRDADA configuration across all nodes in the cluster, monitor all relevant processes, configure and control through a web-based interface, interface with observatory scheduling tools, and manage the ownership and archival of project data. It has been used in the implementation of baseband recording and processing instrumentation for radio pulsar astronomy.},

  abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},
